-- 02 The  employees table has the reportsTo column that references to the employeeNumber column. The reportsTo column stores the ids of managers. The top manager does not report to anyone in the companyâ€™s organization structure, therefore, the value in the reportsTo column is NULL.

-- You can apply the recursive CTE to query the whole organization structure in the top-down manner ADDING CUSTOM LEVEL INFORMATION as follows:

WITH RECURSIVE employee_levels AS
  ( -- start by getting the manager
    SELECT employeeNumber,
           reportsTo managerNumber,
           officeCode, 
           1 Level

   UNION ALL -- combine the following to this previous SELECT
   SELECT e.employeeNumber,
            e.reportsTo,
            e.officeCode,
            Level+1

-- explaination ,,

-- 1 lvl is start value for each iteration of the recursive call, increases each loop
